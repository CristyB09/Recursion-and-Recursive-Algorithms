         Recursion
    Why learn recursion?
    • It represents a new mode of thinking
    • Provides a powerful programming paradigm
    • Can give insight into nature of computation
    Naturally self-referential computational artifacts
    • File systems with folders containing folders
    • Fractal graphics patterns
    • Divide and conqueror algorithms

         Iteration & Recursion
     
     Repetition is a major feature of many algorithms (repeating actions rapidly is a key ability of
     computers!)
     Iteration & Recursion
     Two problem-solving processes involve
     repetition:
     1. Iteration
     2. Recursion
     • At times, iterative solutions are elusive
     or extremely complex
     • Recursive solutions can (sometimes)
     provide an elegant alternative
     
         Example: The Countdown (10 to 1)
     
     First person counts down from 10 then asks next person to count down from 9, etc.
     • Each person calls out the N in their countdown
     • Each successive person is solving thesmaller problem (N – 1)
     Recursion is a problem-solving process that breaks a problem down into identical smaller problems
